<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

IRegEx (or IRE) is an intermediate representation for Regular Expressions
with a well-defined semantics providing a foundation for common Regular
Expression dialects. It also aims at providing easy tools to inspect finite
automata built from regular expressions, or manually.

If you are instead looking for a ready-to-use and feature-rich regular
expression library, please use the [`regex`] library.
