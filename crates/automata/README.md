# NFA and DFA on Unicode scala values for Rust

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

This library provides an implementation of Nondeterministic Finite Automata
(NFA) and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for Unicode scalar values
(the [`char`] type). It is used by the [`iregex`] crate to represent compiled
regular expressions.
